# Blog Content

---

Blog content should be a concise version of the material that we offer for paid subscriptions. Alternatively, blog posts hone in on very specific content that is otherwise not delved into excessively in the primary material. Blog articles should be of interest to our audience, providing supplementary information, resources, and connections to our main base of materials available through subscription. 

Write blog articles only when you have something to say rather than for the purpose of keeping up appearances and schedules of content release. It is better to publish worthwhile content than to post consistently. Quality content is well written and has been well organized. As a general set of guidelines, use the following:

1. Blog post word count should be over 300 words and closer to 1,000. 
2. Use headers and divide content into digestible portions.
3. Avoid list articles and opt instead for narrative formats. 
4. Do not use gimmicks like slideshows, quizzes, infographics, and word clouds.
5. Do not create posts that have distracting imagery \(colors, size, etc.\). Focus on the material itself. 
6. Focus less on SEO and more on create content that's worthwhile to a reader.
