# Organization of Material

---

Content will be available in modular groupings, and sortable by language as well as level of current knowledge in the web development field. The organization of the material will accommodate for the learning taking a non-linear path and side stepping to learn more about a mentioned sub-topic in a section. 

The overarching organization is geared towards the creation of a custom CMS web application from the ground up. As the learner goes through each module, he or she will create part of the user interface or back-end structure of the project. At points in the process, the learner will be able to choose specialities and frameworks to learn. For example, the learner will have the option to build part of the framework in React.js or Angular.js. He or she will also have the option to build the portion out in one of the two JavaScript frameworks mentioned, and go back to learn the other.
