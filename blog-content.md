# Other Content

---

Other content to meet our styling guidelines appears in blog posts, email and newsletter communications, and on social media.

## Blog Content

Blog content should be a concise version of the material that we offer for paid subscriptions. Alternatively, blog posts hone in on very specific content that is otherwise not delved into excessively in the primary material. Blog articles should be of interest to our audience, providing supplementary information, resources, and connections to our main base of materials available through subscription.

Write blog articles only when you have something to say rather than for the purpose of keeping up appearances and schedules of content release. It is better to publish worthwhile content than to post consistently. Quality content is well written and has been well organized. As a general set of guidelines, use the following:

1. Blog post word count should be over 300 words and closer to 1,000. 
2. Use headers and divide content into digestible portions.
3. Avoid list articles and opt instead for narrative formats. 
4. Do not use gimmicks like slideshows, quizzes, infographics, and word clouds.
5. Do not create posts that have distracting imagery \(colors, size, etc.\). Focus on the material itself. 
6. Focus less on SEO and more on create content that's worthwhile to a reader. 

## Newsletter and Email Communications

Generally, all of our communications should have similar tones and not vary drastically. As with blog posts, be conscious of how much content you are producing and be willing to access its worth with honesty. Be courteous of your learner's time and disclose information readily in this format. 

1. Be straightforward and concise. These are formats of communication in which you have a lot less space to talk to your learners.
2. Do not be salesy and do not be pushy. Learners make their own educated choices
3. Do not be sloppy. All communications, no matter how long they take to formulate, are important to our brand image.

## Social Media 

Determine the necessity and relevancy of the content you plan on publishing on social media. Use social media sparingly to communicate important platform updates and additions. Be aware of the way in which the content is received. 

1. Use SFW material on all social media communications \(and across all channels\).
2. Say what matters. Post with care and respect for the time of learners.
3. Do not spam under any circumstance \(across all channels\).
4. Do not ask for a like/repost/etc.
5. Avoid cleverness, exclusive language, and other content that could alienate readers.
6. To address complaints, offer commenters an alternative way to contact us. For example, if someone has a subscription issue, ask them to please email us or submit their complaint through our contact or customer service page.
