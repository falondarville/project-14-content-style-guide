# Writing Style

We commit to empowering people to learn through our actions. Our writing suits these goals:

1. We give straight-forward explanations, examples, and exercise problems.

2. We offer real-world application and context.

3. We engage learners by speaking to them intelligently and clearly.

Our readers and learners come from different backgrounds, so we do not assume their prior knowledge. Whether introducing a topic for the first time or addressing seasoned web developers, we thoroughly explain the jargon and industry-specific terminology and concepts.

Where appropriate, we offer supplemental information through the use of link to blog articles, webpages, and books. We avoid seeming clever, and instead engage our audience with the respect given to a peer and fellow web developer. We follow the principles: explain in hyper-clear terms, and expunge unnecessary and unfruitful content.

We abide by rules of good grammar and style awareness to encourage clarity, brevity, and standardization of text across site authors and platforms of communication:

1. Use the Oxford Comma.
2. Do not write run-on sentences.
3. Avoid semicolons.
4. Try to limit commas to one per sentence.
5. When in doubt, lean on the side of formality and not familiarity.
6. Be concise.
7. Avoid contractions.
8. Use **bold**, _italicization_, and other ~~visual~~ representation of emphasis sparingly. 
9. Spell out special characters outside of code. Example: "&" becomes "and"
10. Avoid puns and word games that distract from the message.

Use common sense and good writing practice to determine cases that have not been explicitly addressed here.

As a professional learning platform, we strive to abide by courtesy in the online sphere through the following:

1. Do not slam competitors, instead focus on what we are doing. 
2. Do not use profanity, suggestive phrasing, sexual allusions, and other NSFW material.
3. Do not talk down to learners.
4. Do not use unfamiliar terms and ideas without explaining them well or offering supplementary links.
5. Do not make assumptions about what your learners know already. 
6. Do not frustrate learners with unnecessary, meaningless, and "insider jargon" content.
