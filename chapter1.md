# Visual Identity

---

Use the following brand guidelines to keep our visual identity consistent across platforms across the web. Your main focus will be on clarity of content and straight-forward representation of the brand. The primary goals in our visual identity include:

1. Accessibility for those with disabilities including dyslexia, color-blindness, and others. We offer preference settings for users to change the visuals of our platform to better serve our diverse learners.
2. Visuals and core branding instill trust in the learner and in our consistent quality.
3. We are a company of real individuals, not a money mill. We take pride in all of the work we do, and this reflects in our attention to detail.
